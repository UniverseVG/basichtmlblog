    <h2 align="center">Python Database Connection: Know how to connect with database</h2>
    <p aria-setsize="20">Databases are critical for storing and processing data even if you consider a powerful programming language like Python. Ever wondered where does this whole large set of data is stored in or fetched from? In this article on “Python database connection”,
        I’ll talk about the same and take you through the following aspects in detail. </p>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>What is a database?</li>
        <li>What is MySQLdb?</li>
        <li>How does Python connect to a database?</li>
        <li>Creating a Database:</li>
        <li>Database Operations[CRUD]:</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Let’s get started &#128516;</h4>
    <br>
    <h2>What is a database?</h2>
    <p aria-setsize="20">A database is basically a collection of structured data in such a way that it can easily be retrieved, managed and accessed in various ways. One of the simplest forms of databases is a text database. Relational databases are the most popular database
        system which includes the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>MySQL</li>
        <li>Oracle Database</li>
        <li>SQL server</li>
        <li>Informix</li>
        <li>Sybase</li>
        <li>IBM db2</li>
        <li>NO SQL</li>
    </ol>
    <p aria-setsize="20">Among all these databases, MySQL is one of the easiest databases to work with. Let me walk you through about this in detail</p>
    <br>
    <h2>What is MySQLdb?</h2>
    <p aria-setsize="20">MySQLdb is an open-source freely available relational database management system that uses Structured Query Language. Now one of the most important question here is “What is SQL?”</p>
    <p aria-setsize="20">SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for relational databases that allow users to do various operations on data like, Manipulating, Creating, Dropping, etc. In a nutshell, SQL allows you to do anything with the data.</p>
    <p aria-setsize="20">Let’s move ahead and dive deep into Python database connection wherein you will learn how to connect with the database.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>How does Python connect to a database? </h2>
    <p aria-setsize="20">It is very simple to connect Python with the database. Refer the below image which illustrates a Python connection with the database where how a connection request is sent to MySQL connector Python, gets accepted from the database and cursor is executed
        with result data.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="db.png" align="center">
    <p aria-setsize="20">Before connecting to the MySQL database, make sure you have MySQL installer installed on your computer. It provides a comprehensive set of tools which helps in installing MySQL with the following components:</p>
    <ol type="i">
        <li>MySQL server</li>
        <li>All available connectors</li>
        <li>MySQL Workbench</li>
        <li>MySQL Notifier</li>
        <li>Tools for Excel and Microsoft Visual Studio</li>
        <li>MySQL Sample Databases</li>
        <li>MySQL Documentation</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p aria-setsize="20">To download the MySQL installer please go through the following video which talks about the various steps that you need to follow while installing MySQL.</p>
    <a href="Video.html">How to Install MySQL on Windows10?</a>
    <p aria-setsize="20">Before proceeding you should make sure you have MySQL db installed on your computer. Refer the below commands for installing MySQL in command prompt and pycharm:</p>
    <p aria-setsize="20">For the basic commands and programs<a href="basic.html">Click here</a></p>
    <h2>Creating a Database:</h2>
    <p aria-setsize="20">Once the database connection is established, you are ready to create your own database which will be acting as a bridge between your python and MySQL server.<br><br> Let’s see the implementation part of it.</p>
    <p aria aria-setsize="20"><b>Example:</b><br>import mysql.connector<br> mydb=mysql.connector.connect(host="localhost",user="root",passwd="password123")

        <br> mycursor=mydb.cursor()
        <br> mycursor.execute("create database varundb")</p>

    <p aria-setsize="20"><b>Output:</b><br>C:/Users/GM Varun/PycharmProjects/test1/venv/python-db-conn.py<br> Process finished with exit code 0</p>
    <p aria-setsize="20"><b>Explanation:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>In the above program, I have made use of cursor which is basically an object that is used to communicate to your entire MySQL server through which I am able to create my own database.</li>
        <li>You can see from the output that my database with the name”harshdb” is created which is custom, as you can give any name to your database.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Database Operations[CRUD]:</h2>
    <p aria-setsize="20">There are numerous operations a programmer can perform using databases and SQL in order to have sound knowledge of database programming and MySQL.Some of them i Have disscussed below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Create–</b> It is an SQL statement used to create a record in the table or can say it is used for creating a table.</li>
        <li><b>Read-</b> It is used for fetching useful information from the database.</li>
        <li><b>Update-</b> This particular SQL statement is used for updating the records in the table or updating the table</li>
        <li><b>Delete- </b> As the name itself justifies this command is used for deleting the table.</li>
    </ul>
    <p aria-setsize="20">Below I have explained create operation only as other operation are easy as create.</p>
    <p aria-setsize="20"><b>Create Operation:</b></p>
    <p aria-setsize="20">import mysql.connector<br> mydb=mysql.connector.connect(host="localhost",user="root",passwd="password123",database=harshdb)

        <br> mycursor=mydb.cursor()

        <br> mycursor.execute("create table employee(name varchar(250),sal int(20))")</p>
    <p aria-setsize="20"><b>Output:</b></p>
    <p aria-setsize="20">C:UsersGM VaruntPycharmProjectstest1venvScriptspython.exe<br> C:/Users/GM Varun/PycharmProjects/test1/venv/python-db-conn.py<br> Process finished with exit code 0</p>
    <p aria-setsize="20"><b>Explanation:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>In the above-given program, I have created a table ’employee’</li>
        <li>Table employee has two fields ‘name’ and ‘sal’.</li>
        <li>Here, the User id is “root” and Password is “password123” used for accessing varundb.</li>
    </ul>
    <p aria-setsize="20">So we Understood How to coonect database with python.Database connectivity is the vital concept in the web developement projects.So understanding this makes the web development very easy</p>
